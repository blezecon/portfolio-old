# Portfolio (Discontinued)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, originally created to showcase my work, skills, and experience using modern frontend technologies and advanced visual effects.
This project has now been discontinued.

The primary blocker was achieving consistent, reliable responsiveness of the 3D model across all devices and screen sizes. Despite extensive optimization and refactoring, this limitation could not be fully resolved without compromising performance or user experience. As a result, development on this version has been halted.

The repository is preserved for learning and reference purposes.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next generation frontend tooling
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [SwipeJS](https://swiperjs.com/) - Modern mobile touch slider
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation library for React
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - JavaScript 3D library
- [lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/) - A smooth scroll library
